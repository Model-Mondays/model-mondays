## Show Format

Every Model Mondays episode consists of a 30-minute livestream with 2 core segments:

- **Model Roundup** (5 min) - each episode starts with a 5-min recap of the top 5 model-related stories that caught our attention last week!
- **Model Spotlight** (20 min) - then, we spend the next 20 minutes putting the spotlight on a specific model or model category to help you understand _why_ it matters, _when_ to use it, and _how_ to get started.

We'll use the last 5 mins for Q&A before we wrap the livestream - but invite you to join us [on #model-mondays in Discord](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/discord) to continue discussions.  Plus, _Office Hours_ on Fridays for show-and-tell demos & watercooler chats.

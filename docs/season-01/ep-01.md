Welcome to the kickoff episode of Model Mondays. 
In this kickoff episode, weâ€™ll introduce our episode format and get started with our first spotlight segment!


## Weekly Highlights

In this weekly segment, we round up 5 news items of interest to AI engineers, with an emphasis on new models or model-related announcements that caught our attention.

## Weekly Spotlight

In this segment, we put the focus on a single model, model family or model feature - and look at it hands-on with code and demos, to get a better intuition for how it works, and where to use it.

By the end of this segment you should know:

1. What GitHub Models are, and why they matter.
1. How to get started with your first GitHub Model.
1. How to compare models for evaluating responses.
1. How to go from catalog (explore) to code (develop)
1. How to use Azure Inference API for easy model swap

## Explore the Code!

In this segment, we made use of two resources:

1. [The GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) - UI-first approach
1. [The GitHub Codespaces-Models repo](https://github.com/github/codespaces-models) - code-first approach

Check back later for an updated section of _this_ repository where you can try these out interactively, with instructions.

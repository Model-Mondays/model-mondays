In this segment, we put the focus on a single model, model family or model feature - and look at it hands-on with code and demos, to get a better intuition for how it works, and where to use it.

By the end of this segment you should know:

1. What Reasoning Models are, and why they matter.
1. How Reasoning Models work - with a use case!
1. What kinds of problems they solve - more examples!
1. When to NOT use these models - think tradeoffs
1. Where you can go to get hands on code samples

## Explore the Code!

In this segment, we made use of two resources:

1. [The GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) - try the models out for free!
1. [Azure AI Foundry Model Catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models) - explore more models in depth!
1. [Jennifer Marsman's Sample Repo](https://github.com/jennifermarsman/o1Analysis) - repository with core sample

Check back later for an updated section of _this_ repository where you can try these out interactively, with instructions.
